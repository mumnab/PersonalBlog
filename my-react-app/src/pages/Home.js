        <p> Welcome to my little corner of the internet! When I’m not coding or experimenting with this website, you’ll probably find me curled up with a good book, crocheting, sewing, baking something delicious, or planning my next adventure with family and friends. This blog is my digital garden, a space to grow, reflect, and share thoughts, creations, and experiences.</p>
